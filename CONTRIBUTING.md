## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to standardize commit messages.

Types include:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g., formatting)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- chore: Other changes like infra or CI/CD

## Branching Strategy

We follow a [Trunk-based Branching Strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development)
In order to accommodate scaling up the project as it grows over time, we will be implementing a Scaled Trunk-Based Development approach within our GitHub repository. This will consist of a main branch (trunk) that will act as the continuous development branch . New features that have been outlined in Epics/Stories that have been agreed upon by the team will be developed in downstream feature branches adhering to the following format: feature/<new-capability>. After sufficient review and approval by the team, these feature branches will be merged back into the main branch. Lastly, versioned release branches will be cut from the main branch using semantic versioning standards. i.e release/1.0.0.

## Testing Requirements

## Pull Request Process

When submitting a pull request (PR), please follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure your branch is to date with Main.
2. Open a pull request with the PR template filled out so we can link the branch to the Jira Issue
3. Ensure all tests pass, and linting issues are resolved.

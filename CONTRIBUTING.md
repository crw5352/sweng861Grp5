## Project Setup

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to standardize commit messages.

Types include:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g., formatting)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- chore: Other changes like infra or CI/CD

## Branching Strategy

We follow a [Trunk-based Branching Strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development)
When creating a new branch off of main (the trunk), prefix it with feat/ for features, fix/ for bugfixes, docs/, or chore/ for other contributions.

## Testing Requirements

## Pull Request Process

When submitting a pull request (PR), please follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure your branch is to date with Main.
2. Open a pull request with the PR template filled out so we can link the branch to the Jira Issue
3. Ensure all tests pass, and linting issues are resolved.

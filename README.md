# BitFit

## Mission

Our mission is to empower individuals through innovative social fitness competitions regardless of user preference in wearable technology — together, we will get a BitFit.

## Problem

Vendor lock-in with fitness wearable brands creates a barrier where users cannot share their health and fitness data.

## Solution

Create a fitness tracking dashboard compatible with a variety of wearable devices for user convenience in tracking their friend's progress as well as their own.

## Product Scope

The product will be a web application. The scope of our app includes user registration, group formation, leaderboards, goal tracking, the display of health data for an individual, and public display of data for groups. We would like to utilize a pub-sub pattern to decouple the application’s services and allow for further evolution of the architecture. We want to support a maintainable application and will accomplish this through containers. The health data will be gathered via 3rd party SDKs and authentication to the user’s tracking device will be handled through 3rd parties.
